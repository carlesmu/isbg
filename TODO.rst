Todo list
=========

High priority
-------------
* ☑ Write program as main()

* □ Add a manpage.

Other stuff
-----------
* □ Export documentation.
* □ Add documentation about development.
* □ Easily upload to pypy.
* □ Auto report messages to Razor (high scoring ones that are definitely spam)
* □ Delete the semi-encryption of passwords (Security through obscurity !=
  security)
* □ Seperate out messages that may be false positives (scores close to
  SpamAssassin thresholds) from the definite spam ones.
* ☑ Correct the use of subprocess Popen (pipe.communicate() is the way to go)
* □ Add documentation for the crontab usage.
* ☑ Stop using working dir as cache
