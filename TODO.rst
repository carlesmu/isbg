Todo list
=========

High priority
-------------
* ☑ Write program as main()
* □ Set a 50 emails partial run defaut and loop it

Other stuff
-----------
* □ Auto report messages to Razor (high scoring ones that are definitely spam)
* □ Delete the semi-encryption of passwords (Security through obscurity !=
  security)
* □ Seperate out messages that may be false positives (scores
  close to SpamAssassin thresholds) from the definite spam ones.
* □ Correct the use of subprocess Popen (pipe.communicate() is the way to go)
* ☑ Stop using working dir as cache
* ☑ python 3
