IMAP Spam Begone
================

`isbg` is a script and a python module that makes it easy to scan an IMAP inbox
for spam using SpamAssassin and get your spam moved to another folder.

Unlike the normal mode of deployments for *SpamAssassin*, `isbg` does not need
to be involved in mail delivery, and can run on completely different machines
to where your mailbox actually is. So this is the perfect tool to take good
care of your ISP mailbox without having to leave it.
